# C Practice Projects

Collection of beginner C programs to practice core programming concepts:
arrays, loops, pointers, bitwise operations, pattern printing, prime algorithms, and more.

## Structure
- `patterns/` — pattern-printing programs (triangles, shapes)
- `maths/` — number-theory programs (primes, Fibonacci)
- `bitwise/` — bitwise operation examples
- `utilities/` — small utilities (calculator, digit sorter)

## How to compile and run
Compile a program with `gcc`:
```bash
gcc path/to/file.c -o program
./program
