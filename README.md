# C Practice Projects

This repository contains all the C programming practice tasks, exercises, and small projects I created during my **first semester** while learning the C language.

These programs represent my hands-on learning journey in C — covering core topics such as:

- Variables & Data Types  
- Conditional Statements  
- Loops  
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Functions  
- Pointers  
- Structures  
- File Handling  
- Mini-Projects  

Each `.c` file in this repository is an individual program that I wrote and practiced during the semester. Header files I created are included as `.h` files for modularity.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository intentionally contains:
- `.c` files → All source code  
- `.h` files → My custom header files  
- `README.md` → This document

The repo does *not* include:
- Compiled output files  
- `.o` object files  
- Temporary / build files  

## 🎯 Purpose

- Track my C programming progress  
- Organize all semester coding work  
- Build a coding habit  
- Show my development journey publicly

## 🧑‍💻 How to Compile & Run

Using GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
